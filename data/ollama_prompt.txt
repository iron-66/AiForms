This is an image of a form. Please output all of the questions in the form as a JSON array of objects. The array has the key "pages" and each question has the keys “id”, “question_text", "hint_text" and "answer_type". The value of "question_text" is the title of the question. The value of "hint_text" is any hint text for the question, or null if there is no hint text. The value of "answer_type" is one of the following: "number", "email", "name", "national_insurance_number", "phone_number", "organisation_name", "address", "date", "selection", "text”. Don’t come up with your own questions, work only with those in the photo.
