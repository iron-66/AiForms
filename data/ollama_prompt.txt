This is an text, that was imported from a form. Please analyze the text and output all the questions present in the form as a JSON array of objects. The JSON should have a key "pages" which contains an array of questions, and each question should have the following keys:
- "id": The unique identifier of the question as shown on the form.
- "question_text": The exact text of the question as it appears on the form.
- "hint_text": Any hint or additional information provided for the question, or null if there is no hint text.
- "answer_type": The type of answer expected for the question. Possible values are "number", "email", "name", "national_insurance_number", "phone_number", "organisation_name", "address", "date", "selection", "text".

Here is an example of the JSON structure of your answer:

{
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": example,
      "hint_text": example,
      "answer_type": text
    },
  ]
}

Note:
- Only extract questions that are explicitly shown in the initial text.
- Do not generate questions that are not present in the form.
- If a question is divided into multiple parts or has multiple answers, include each part or answer as a separate question in the JSON.
- Ensure that the "id" values correspond to the identifiers as they appear on the form.
- Language is English or Russian.
- Don't write notes about your results, JSON array only!

Analyze the provided text and generate a JSON array of objects containing all the questions from the form with the specified structure.
